# GPGenie

GPGenie is a Go-based tool for generating, managing, and analyzing GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys with a focus on ED25519 keys. It provides functionality to generate keys with specific characteristics, store them in a database, and export keys based on various criteria.

## Features

- Generate ED25519 GPG keys with customizable parameters
- Store generated keys in PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- Score keys based on various criteria (repeating patterns, increasing/decreasing sequences, etc.)
- Export top-scoring keys or keys with low letter count
- Configurable via JSON configuration file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/iyuangang/gpgenie.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

    "Host": "localhost",
    "Port": 5432,
    "User": "your_username",
    "Password": "your_password",
    "DBName": "gpgenie",
    "MaxOpenConns": 10,
    "MaxIdleConns": 5,
    "ConnMaxLifetime": 300
  },
  "Processing": {
    "BatchSize": 100,
    "MaxConcurrentFiles": 4
  },
  "Metrics": {
    "Port": 8080
  },
  "KeyGeneration": {
    "TotalKeys": 1000000,
    "NumWorkers": 4,
    "MinScore": 100,
    "MaxLettersCount": 5,
    "Name": "GPGenie",
    "Comment": "Generated by GPGenie",
    "Email": "gpgenie@example.com"
  }
}
```

Adjust the values according to your needs.

## Usage

Run the GPGenie tool with the following command-line options:

```
gpgenie [options]

Options:
  -config string
        Path to config file (default "config.json")
  -generate-keys
        Generate GPG keys
  -export-top int
        Export top N keys by score
  -export-low-letter int
        Export N keys with lowest letter count
  -output string
        Output file for exported keys (default "exported_keys.csv")
```

### Examples

1. Generate keys:
   ```
   ./gpgenie -generate-keys
   ```

2. Export top 100 keys:
   ```
   ./gpgenie -export-top 100 -output top_keys.csv
   ```

3. Export 50 keys with lowest letter count:
   ```
   ./gpgenie -export-low-letter 50 -output low_letter_keys.csv
   ```
